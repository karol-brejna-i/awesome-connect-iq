Quite fresh. "- "Save matches as Garmin Connect activities" - could be good example for saving custom activities.

[GitHub - rgibert/garmin-podcasts: Garmin Podcasts is a Garmin Connect IQ podcast app powered by Podcast Index. No external service or subscription required: all you need is you watch!](https://github.com/rgibert/garmin-podcasts)

[GitHub - danielsiwiec/timebomb: Timebomb game for garmin](https://github.com/danielsiwiec/timebomb). Looks like a game. Had not run it yet. The code seems clean. There is even a model passd to the delegate. Don't expect sofisticated mechanics/techniques, though.

[andryuha49/GarminTrexGame](https://github.com/andryuha49/GarminTrexGame) Quite fresh (2020), good readme. Game from google chrome. (A bit slow, judging from the demo video. Not sure if coding/techniques are good.)

[https://github.com/hansiglaser/ConnectIQ](https://github.com/hansiglaser/ConnectIQ) Collection of Garmin Connect IQ apps. SimpleWaF (watch face) is a very simple watch face, just a finger exercise. ShowAllInfos (widget) retrieves all available information (e.g., screen size, heart rate, ...) and displays it.

https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/9499ec2c-d424-4135-a62d-130956bc1a6f
A watch application that helps you to take a contrast shower every day and keep your health in great shape.

[noln/doughnuts-burnt](https://github.com/noln/doughnuts-burnt) [Watch App]
    A simple Garmin Connect IQ app for the Fenix 5X fitness GPS watch that shows the number of doughnuts burnt so far today.
    Pretty old: Dec 3, 2017
    Based on Eclipse.
    Source code mangled: random spaces, no comments, strange line breaks.
    The idea is interesting, but the code is not.
    https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityMonitor/Info.html
    Probably candidate for "rejected".

    Quite to the point. Main features: `Communications.makeWebRequest(); dc.drawBitmap();  dc.drawText()`
    Note: The app store says it is a widget; source code shows it is an app -- verify
